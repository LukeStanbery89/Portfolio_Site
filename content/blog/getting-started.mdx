# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings exciting new features and improvements to the React framework. In this post, we'll explore the App Router and how to build modern web applications.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js is a powerful React framework that provides:

- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- File-based routing
- Built-in optimization

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS.

## App Router

The App Router is the new routing system in Next.js 13+. It uses the `app` directory and provides better performance and developer experience.

### Creating Pages

To create a new page, simply add a `page.tsx` file in the `app` directory:

```typescript
export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Welcome to Next.js!</h1>
        </div>
    );
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 makes it easier than ever to build fast, modern web applications. Give it a try for your next project!
